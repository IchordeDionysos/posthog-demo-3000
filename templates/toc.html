        <h3>🎬 Terms & Conditions of HOGFLIX 🎬</h3>
        <p><strong>1. Binge Responsibly</strong><br>
        Yes, we know you’re here to binge-watch 17 seasons of that show everyone’s talking about. Just remember: no blaming us when you emerge from your cave three days later, hungry, tired, and questioning your life choices. We warned you. 🍕☕️
        </p>
        
        <p><strong>2. Your Watchlist = Your Responsibility</strong><br>
        That watchlist you’ve been curating like it’s the Louvre? We’re proud of you! Just don’t complain when you can’t decide what to watch and end up re-watching <i>The Office</i> for the 57th time. It’s on you. 🎨
        </p>
        
        <p><strong>3. Sharing is (Not Always) Caring</strong><br>
        We’re all about community, but if your “friend” who’s using your account isn’t contributing to the pizza fund, it might be time for a tough conversation. Remember, freeloaders aren’t friends—they’re just people who need to get their own subscription. 🍕💸
        </p>
        
        <p><strong>4. Buffering…Is a State of Mind</strong><br>
        On the rare occasion that your video buffers, take it as a sign from the universe to reflect on life, do some yoga, or maybe, just maybe, check your internet connection. It’s not us—it’s you. 🧘‍♂️🌐
        </p>
        
        <p><strong>5. Content Overload Disclaimer</strong><br>
        We provide endless content. Seriously. But if you get overwhelmed by choices and end up watching cat videos on YouTube instead, well, that’s just the circle of life, my friend. 🐱📺
        </p>
        
        <p><strong>6. “Continue Watching?” Button Fatigue</strong><br>
        If you’re sick of seeing “Continue Watching?” pop up, just remember: this is our polite way of checking if you’re still with us or if you’ve entered a food coma. No judgment. 🍿😴
        </p>
        
        <p><strong>7. Spoilers Will Not Be Tolerated</strong><br>
        Spoiling the latest episode of <i>anything</i> is punishable by immediate and permanent excommunication from your friends' group chat. We don’t make the rules (okay, maybe we do). 🤐📵
        </p>
        
        <p><strong>8. Offline Viewing = Digital Hoarding</strong><br>
        Downloading shows to watch offline is cool, but if your device turns into a hoarder’s paradise, don’t come crying to us when your storage is full. Spring cleaning isn’t just for closets. 📱📂
        </p>
        
        <p><strong>9. No Telepathic Content Requests</strong><br>
        We’re good, but we can’t read your mind—yet. So if you’re wondering why that super obscure 90s show isn’t available, try typing it in the search bar instead of just thinking really hard about it. 🧠💭
        </p>
        
        <p><strong>10. You Can Cancel Anytime (But You Won’t)</strong><br>
        Yes, you <i>can</i> cancel your subscription at any time. But let’s be real: you’re not going anywhere. We’ve got more seasons and cliffhangers than you have willpower. 🎣
        </p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong><br>
        Relax, enjoy, and binge responsibly. We’ve got you covered—until you run out of snacks.
        </p>
